## Overview
Virtual elevator is a Singe Page App that is built utilizing the React framework. A user can request elevator stops on the keypad and see the elevator travel to the requested floor. Once the elevator reaches the requested floor, the elevator will wait for 3 seconds before returning to the first floor or traveling to the next requested stop. If there are requested stops between the current floor and the initially requested one, the elevator will only stop on them if it has not traveled beyond them.

## Installation

From your terminal:
* ```fork git@github.com:DashaDaria/virtual-elevator-react.git & clone locally```
* ```cd into virtual-elevator-react from your local directory```
* ```npm install && npm start```
